Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, activist, and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s.[3] Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists.[4] By 1974, he was one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as "among the most beloved entertainers of his era".[5] 
Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed, with total sales of over 33 million records worldwide.[6] He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, his disdain for city life, his enthusiasm for music, and his relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including country music, the Billboard Hot 100, and adult contemporary, in all earning 12 gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs "Take Me Home, Country Roads", "Annie's Song", "Rocky Mountain High", "Calypso", "Thank God I'm a Country Boy", and "Sunshine on My Shoulders". 
Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s. He continued to record in the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues by lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of Congress in protest against censorship in music. He lived in Aspen, Colorado, for much of his life and was known for his love of Colorado, which he sang about numerous times. In 1974, Denver was named poet laureate of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted "Rocky Mountain High" as one of its two state songs in 2007. 
Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. was born in Roswell, New Mexico, to Captain (later LTC) Henry John "Dutch" Deutschendorf,[7] a United States Army Air Forces pilot stationed at Roswell AAF and his wife, Erma Louise (Swope).
Years later, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, Deutschendorf Sr. would set three speed records in the B-58 Hustler bomber and earn a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame.
He met and married his "Oklahoma Sweetheart".

The Akita (秋田犬 Akita-inu, Japanese pronunciation: [akʲita.inɯ]) is a medium breed of dog originating from the mountainous regions of northern Japan. There are two separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called "Akita Inu" ("inu" means "dog" in Japanese), or "Japanese Akita"; and an American strain, known as the "Akita" or "American Akita".[2] The Japanese strain comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes in all dog colors.[3] The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.

The Akita is a powerful, independent and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.

In all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the "Great Japanese Dog". Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of Hachikō, a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before World War II.
There is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita. To date, only the American Kennel Club,[4] consider American and Japanese Akitas to be two varieties of the same breed, allowing free breeding between the two. The United Kennel Club,[5] The Federation Cynologique Internationale,[6] The Kennel Club,[7][8] the Australian National Kennel Council,[9] the New Zealand Kennel Club,[10][11] and the Japan Kennel Club[citation needed] consider Japanese and American Akitas as separate breeds.[12] Some countries refer to the American Akita as simply the "Akita" and not the American Akita. The issue is especially controversial in Japan.[13] For the FCI's 84 countries, the breed split formally occurred June 1999, when the FCI decided that the American type would be called the Great Japanese Dog,[12] later renamed the American Akita in January 2006.[12]
Japanese history, both verbal and written, describe the ancestors of the Akita, the Matagi dog （Japanese:マタギ犬）(hunting dog, Bear hunting dog, Deer hunting dog),[14] as one of the oldest of the native dogs. Today's Akita developed primarily from dogs in the northernmost region of the island of Honshū in the Akita prefecture, thus providing the breed's name.[14] The Matagi's quarry included wild boar, Sika deer, and Asian black bear.[citation needed] This precursor dog tracked large game, holding it at bay until hunters arrived to make the kill. The breed is also influenced by crosses with larger breeds from Asia and Europe, including English Mastiffs,[citation needed] Great Danes,[14] St. Bernards,[14] and the Tosa Inu,[14] in the desire to develop a fighting dog for the burgeoning dog fighting industry in Odate in the early 20th century.[14] During World War II the Akita was also crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled.[14] The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.[12] 
The story of Hachikō, the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world. Hachikō was born in 1923 and owned by Professor Hidesaburō Ueno of Tokyo.[15] Professor Ueno lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a suburb of the city and commuted to work every day on the train.[16] Hachikō accompanied his master to and from the station each day.[16] On May 25, 1925, when the dog was 18 months old, he waited for his master's arrival on the four o'clock train, but Professor Ueno had a fatal brain haemorrhage at work.[16] Hachikō continued to wait for his master's return.[16] He travelled to and from the station each day for the next nine years.[16] He allowed the professor's relatives to care for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master.[16] His vigil became world-renowned when, in 1934,[17] shortly before his death, a bronze statue was erected at the Shibuya train station in his honor.[16] This statue was melted down for munitions during the war, but a new one was commissioned after the war.[17] Each year on April 8 since 1936, Hachikō's devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Tokyo's Shibuya railroad station.[18][19] Eventually, Hachikō's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of the Emperor.[20]
In 1931, the Akita was officially declared a Japanese Natural Monument. The Mayor of Odate City in Akita Prefecture organized the Akita Inu Hozonkai to preserve the original Akita as a Japanese natural treasure through careful breeding.[16] In 1934 the first Japanese breed standard for the Akita Inu was listed, following the breed's declaration as a natural monument of Japan.[21] In 1967, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Akita Dog Preservation Society, the Akita Dog Museum was built to house information, documents and photos.[16] There is a tradition in Japan, that when a child is born they receive a statue of an Akita. This statue symbolizes health, happiness, and a long life.[22]
In 1937, Helen Keller travelled to Japan. She expressed a keen interest in the breed and was presented with the first two Akitas to enter the US.[24] The first dog, presented to her by Mr. Ogasawara and named Kamikaze-go, died at 7 1/2 months of age from distemper, one month after her return to the States. A second Akita was arranged to be sent to Miss Keller: Kamikaze's litter brother, Kenzan-go.[25] Kenzan-go died in the mid-1940s.[26] By 1939 a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after World War II began.[citation needed] Keller wrote in the Akita Journal: 
If ever there was an angel in fur, it was Kamikaze. I know I shall never feel quite the same tenderness for any other pet. The Akita dog has all the qualities that appeal to me — he is gentle, companionable and trusty.[27][28]
Just as the breed was stabilizing in its native land, World War II pushed the Akita to the brink of extinction. Early in the war the dogs had a lack of nutritious food. Then many were killed to be eaten by the starving populace, and their pelts were used as clothing. Finally, the government ordered all remaining dogs to be killed on sight to prevent the spread of disease. The only way concerned owners could save their beloved Akitas was to turn them loose in remote mountain areas, where they bred back with their ancestor dogs, the Matagi,[14] or conceal them from authorities by means of crossing with German Shepherds, and naming them in the style of German Shepherds of the time.[14] Morie Sawataishi and his efforts to breed the Akita is a major reason this breed exists today.[29]

During the occupation years following the war, the breed began to thrive again through the efforts of Sawataishi and others.[23] For the first time, Akitas were bred for a standardized appearance.[30] Akita fanciers in Japan began gathering and exhibiting the remaining Akitas and producing litters in order to restore the breed to sustainable numbers and to accentuate the original characteristics of the breed muddied by crosses to other breeds.[31] U.S. servicemen fell in love with the Akita and imported many with them upon their return. 
The Japanese Akita and American Akita began to diverge in type during the Post–World War II era[citation needed], even though, earlier in Japan they already distinguished between a pure bred Akita and not. For example Hachiko was a pure bred Akita. Helen Keller is credited with bringing the Akita to America after being gifted two Akitas by the Japanese government in 1938. A breed standard by 1939 and dog shows began to be held but then World War 2 began.[32] It was during this time, that US servicemen serving as part of the occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita, the breed so impressed them that many servicemembers chose to bring an Akita back home with them upon completion of their tour.[citation needed] American servicemembers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear-like fighting Akita or German Shepherd type than they were with the smaller framed and fox-like Akita-Inu; the types of dogs they brought back with them to the US reflected this sentiment.[citation needed] Japanese Akita fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of Japanese art or to 'Natural Monument' status.[citation needed] American Akita fanciers chose to breed larger, heavier-boned and more intimidating dogs.[citation needed] Although, both types derive from a common ancestry, there are marked differences between the two.[33] First, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, white, or brindle.[citation needed] Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards.[citation needed] American Akitas generally are heavier boned and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head.[12]

Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1955, it was placed in the Miscellaneous class.[citation needed] It was not until the end of 1972 that the AKC approved the Akita standard and it was moved to the Working dog class, as such, the Akita is a rather new breed in the United States.[citation needed] Foundation stock in America continued to be imported from Japan until 1974 when the AKC cut off registration to any further Japanese imports until 1992 when it recognized the Japan Kennel Club.[citation needed] The decision by the AKC to disallow the registration of any further imported dogs in 1974, set the stage for the divergence in type between the American Akita and Japanese Akita Inu that is present today.[citation needed]

Elsewhere in the world, the American Akita was first introduced to the UK in 1937, he was a Canadian import, owned by a Mrs. Jenson, the descendants of Mrs. Jenson live on today breeding American Akitas, the most widely known of them is Mr. Joseph Felton, a widely known & award winning Akita breeder, however the breed was not widely known until the early 1980s.[26] The breed was introduced in Australia in 1982 with an American Import and to New Zealand in 1986 with an import from the U.K.[26] 
As a spitz breed, the appearance of the Akita reflects cold weather adaptations essential to their original function.[34] The Akita is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones.[citation needed] Characteristic physical traits of the breed include a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a slight angle following the arch of the neck.[citation needed] Additionally, the eyes of the Akita are small, dark, deeply set and triangular in shape.[35] Akitas have thick double coats, and tight, well knuckled cat-like feet.[citation needed] Their tails are carried over the top of the back in a gentle or double curl down the loin.[36]

Mature American type males measure typically 26–28 inches (66–71 cm) at the withers and weigh between 100–130 lb (45–59 kg).[citation needed] Mature females typically measure 24–26 inches (61–66 cm) and weigh between 70–100 lb (32–45 kg).[37] The Japanese type, as stated in the breed standards, are a little smaller and lighter.[citation needed]

Breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors are allowable in the American Akita, including pinto, all types of brindle, solid white, black mask, white mask, self-colored mask, even differing colors of under coat and overlay (guard hairs).[38] This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern known as Urajiro.[citation needed] The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn, sesame, brindle, pure white, all with "Urajiro" markings i.e., whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body and tail and on the inside of the legs.[7]
