Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. (December 31, 1943 â€“ October 12, 1997), known professionally as John Denver, was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, activist, and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s.[3] Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists.[4] By 1974, he was one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as "among the most beloved entertainers of his era".[5]
